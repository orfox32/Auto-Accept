## League of Legends Auto Accept Queue

Welcome to the League of Legends Auto Accept Queue project! This C++ tool is designed to automate the process of accepting queue pop-ups in League of Legends.

## How It Works

League of Legends Auto Accept Queue is a C++ script/tool designed to automatically accept queue pop-ups in League of Legends. The tool works by continuously monitoring your game client for the appearance of the queue pop-up window. Once detected, it automatically accepts the queue, allowing you to swiftly enter into matches without having to manually accept each time.

## Features

* **Automated Queue Acceptance:** Automatically accepts queue pop-ups in League of Legends.
* **Lightweight:** The tool is designed to be lightweight and have minimal impact on system resources.
* **Easy to Use:** Simple setup and usage instructions provided.

## Future Ideas

* **Auto Ban and Auto Pick:** Implement functionality to automatically ban and pick champions during the ban and pick phases of the game. This feature would streamline the champion selection process, ensuring that players get their desired champions without manual input.
* **Auto Runes and Spells** Integrate automated rune and Spells selection based on predefined configurations or adaptive algorithms. This feature would optimize player setups for their selected champions and playstyles, enhancing in-game performance.
* **User Interface (UI) Development:** Create a user-friendly interface to provide players with more control over the program's settings and to display relevant information such as match details, acceptance status, champion selections, and rune setups. The UI would enhance the overall user.

## Usage

1. **Download the Tool:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Build the Project:** Use your preferred C++ compiler to build the project.
3. **Configure Settings:** Customize the settings file according to your preferences.
4. **Run the Executable:** Execute the compiled executable and let it run in the background while playing League of Legends.
5. **Enjoy:** Sit back and let the tool automatically accept queue pop-ups for you!
